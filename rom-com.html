        each other, they are too proud to confess their love, as they believe whoever does so first would "lose" in

      <p class="C"><strong>SYNOPSIS:- </strong><br><br>
        In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations of Westalis and Ostania,[a] a Westalian agent
        code-named "Twilight" is tasked with spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within
        Ostania. However, due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him is to
        enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a fellow parent.

        To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he creates the alias of Loid Forger, adopts a young
        orphan girl named Anya, and marries a woman named Yor Briar. However, unbeknownst to him Anya can read minds and
        Yor is in fact a professional assassin. Neither Loid nor Yor are aware of each other's true identities, or that
        Anya knows their true professions.
