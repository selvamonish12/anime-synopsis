      <p class="Brinda"><strong>TITLE:- PSYCO-PASS</strong></p>
      <p class="C"><strong>SYNOPSIS:-</strong><br><br>
        Psycho-Pass is seen through the eyes of Akane Tsunemori, a rookie Inspector within Unit One (aka Division One)
        of the Ministry of Welfare Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department. Shinya Kogami is an
        Enforcer under her watch during her first mission. When she judges him a threat to an apprehended criminal's
        life, she uses her Dominator to prevent him from decomposing the criminal. Initially ashamed of her action,
        Kogami thanks her for preventing what could be perceived as murder, an opinion which influences Tsunemori to
        stay on the force. The unit uncovers the crimes of Shogo Makishima, a prolific criminal mastermind. Makishima is
        Criminally Asymptomatic (免罪体質, Menzai Taishitsu) – a person persistently assessed by the Sibyl System as having
        a low crime coefficient despite all actions and attitudes, thus protecting him from Dominator harm. Tsunemori is
        accompanied by veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza, a strict man who looks down on Enforcers; Tomomi Masaoka, a
        middle-aged Enforcer who used to be a detective; Shusei Kagari, a carefree young man who was marked as a latent
        criminal in childhood; and Yayoi Kunizuka, a former musician turned into a latent criminal stemming from a
        relationship with a terrorist.

        Obstetrician-gynecologist Gorou Amamiya is tasked with helping deliver the children of Ai Hoshino, a famous pop
        idol whom he admires, without the knowledge of the general public. However, on the night of Ai's delivery, Gorou
        is murdered by an obsessive fan of Ai's and is reincarnated as Aquamarine "Aqua" Hoshino, Ai's son, retaining
        his memories of his previous life. Unbeknownst to him, Aqua's fraternal twin sister, Ruby Hoshino, is the
        reincarnation of Sarina Tendōji, one of Gorou's patients who was a fan of Ai's. Four years later, Ai is murdered
        by the same fan who had killed Gorou. The fan later commits suicide, but Aqua deduces that the murderer may have
        had his and Ruby's father as an accomplice and resolves to infiltrate the entertainment industry to find and
        kill him.

        Twelve years later, Aqua and Ruby have become high school students and have been adopted by Ichigo and Miyako

      <p class="C"><strong>SYNOPSIS:-</strong><br><br>
        In the year 2045, 1,000 years after the formation of "The Promise", the bright and cheerful Emma is an
        11-year-old orphan living in Grace Field House, a self-contained orphanage housing her and 37 other orphans.
        They lead an idyllic life, with plentiful food, plush beds, clean clothes, games and the love of their "Mom",
        Isabella. Their education is seen as an important part of their development, and Emma, with her two best friends
        Norman and Ray, always excels in the regular exams. The orphans are allowed complete freedom, except to venture
        beyond the perimeter wall or gate which separate the house from the outside world. One night, a girl named Conny
        is sent away to be "adopted", but Emma and Norman follow with her favorite stuffed animal toy. At the gate, they
        find Conny dead and discover the truth about their existence in this idyllic orphanage – to be raised as meat
        for demons. Emma and Norman plan with Ray to escape from Grace Field House with the children, but Norman is
        taken off to be "adopted". Emma and Ray then decide to escape with some of their other siblings, leaving half of
        the younger children behind.
